# SpotifyCleanConverter
The Spotify Clean Converter is a Python-based tool designed to clean your Spotify playlists by replacing explicit tracks with clean versions. This application makes use of the Spotify Web API to search for and replace explicit songs in your playlists with their clean counterparts, automating the process of playlist sanitization.

# Features
User Authentication: Users authenticate through Spotify using their username.
Playlist Selection: Users can select any of their playlists to clean.
Track Search and Replacement: The app searches Spotify for clean versions of explicit tracks and replaces them.
New Playlist Creation: If desired, a new playlist with cleaned tracks can be created instead of overwriting the original.
Error Handling: Tracks that do not have clean versions are logged, and the app will inform you of any failures.

# Usage
Run this code in your terminal, and follow the onscreen instructions to clean your playlists. Offers the ability to override an exisiting playlist, or write to a new one!
